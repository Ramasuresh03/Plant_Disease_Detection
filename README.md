Plant Disease Detection using Image Processing
==
This project aims to develop an efficient and accurate system for detecting plant diseases using image processing techniques. The goal is to identify different types of diseases in plants by analyzing images of leaves, helping farmers take early action and reduce the impact of diseases on crop yields.

For Successful running of project please download the below dataset from drive link:

After downloading the dataset file it will be placed in the Flask_Deployed_App folder and open command prompt to install the requirements.

Plant diseases can have a significant impact on crop productivity, causing damage that could be reduced with early detection. This project uses image processing and machine learning algorithms to detect plant diseases, particularly focusing on leaves' appearance. The system classifies the images into various categories (e.g., healthy plant, bacterial infection, fungal disease) based on visual features like color, shape, and texture of the leaf.

Features
==
Disease Classification: Detect and classify plant diseases (e.g., blight, rust, mildew) using images of leaves.
Image Processing: Utilizes techniques like thresholding, contour detection, and color analysis for disease identification.
Machine Learning: Trains models using labeled datasets to predict the disease with high accuracy.
User-Friendly Interface: Simple command-line or GUI-based interface for easy usage.
Real-time Detection: Capable of detecting diseases from live camera input or images uploaded by users.
Technologies Used
Python: Programming language used for the development of the application.
OpenCV: Open Source Computer Vision Library for image processing.
TensorFlow/Keras: For machine learning and neural network training.
NumPy: For numerical operations and matrix manipulations.
Pandas: For data manipulation and dataset handling.
Scikit-learn: For implementing machine learning algorithms.
